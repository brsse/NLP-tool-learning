In this study, the topic of\nsymmetric similarity 3D coordinate transformation based on the dual quaternion\nalgorithm is discussed, and the bottlenecks encountered in solving the problem\nand the solution method are discussed.

Vision Transformers extract visual information by representing\nimage regions as transformed tokens and integrating them via attention weights.\nHowever, existing post-hoc explanation methods merely consider these attention\nweights, neglecting crucial information from the transformed tokens, which\nfails to accurately illustrate the rationales behind the models' predictions.\nTo incorporate the influence of token transformation into interpretation, we\npropose TokenTM, a novel post-hoc explanation method that utilizes our\nintroduced measurement of token transformation effects. Specifically, we\nquantify token transformation effects by measuring changes in token lengths and\ncorrelations in their directions pre- and post-transformation. Moreover, we\ndevelop initialization and aggregation rules to integrate both attention\nweights and token transformation effects across all layers, capturing holistic\ntoken contributions throughout the model.

Existing methods\ndecompose transformations based on algebraic independence, but these methods\nprimarily focus on commutative transformations and do not extend to cases where\ntransformations are conditionally independent but noncommutative.

The hyperdimensional transform\noffers a powerful, flexible framework that connects closely with other integral\ntransforms, such as the Fourier, Laplace, and fuzzy transforms. Moreover, it\nprovides theoretical foundations and new insights for the field of\nhyperdimensional computing, a computing paradigm that is rapidly gaining\nattention for efficient and explainable machine learning algorithms, with\npotential applications in statistical modelling and machine learning. In\naddition, we provide straightforward and easily understandable code, which can\nfunction as a tutorial and allows for the reproduction of the demonstrated\nexamples, from computing the transform to solving differential equations.", "journal": ""}

However,\nunlike the nonlinear transforms used in variational autoencoder (VAE)-based\nmethods, the goal is to create a simpler yet optimal linear block transform,\nensuring practical integration into existing image and video compression\nstandards. Differently from existing data-driven methods that design transforms\nbased on sample covariance matrices, such as the Karhunen-Lo\\`eve Transform\n(KLT), the proposed RDLT is directly optimized from an RD perspective.\nExperimental results show that this transform significantly outperforms the DCT\nor other existing data-driven transforms. Additionally, it is shown that when\nsimulating the integration of our RDLT into a VVC-like image compression\nframework, the proposed transform brings substantial improvements. All the code\nused in our experiments has been made publicly available at [1].", "journal": ""}

We provide an insight that efficient transformer architectures\ncan be designed by leveraging prior knowledge of tasks and the underlying\nstructure of potential algorithms.

In particular, inspired by the\nstructure of human-designed learning algorithms, our transformer framework\nconsists of a pre-transformer that is responsible for task preprocessing, a\nlooped transformer for iterative optimization algorithms, and a\npost-transformer for producing the desired results after post-processing. We\nprovide theoretical evidence of the expressive power of the AlgoFormer in\nsolving some challenging problems, mirroring human-designed algorithms.\nFurthermore, some theoretical and empirical results are presented to show that\nthe designed transformer has the potential to perform algorithm representation\nand learning.

MSTDT mainly\naddresses the defects of the traditional transformer which has limited ability\nto capture local temporal information. Besides, in order to better model the\ndetailed dynamic information, we make use of the difference feature between\nframes, which practically reflects the dynamic movement of a video. We extract\nthe inter-frame difference feature and integrate the difference and frame\nfeature by the multi-scale temporal transformer. In general, our proposed MSTDT\nconsists of a short-term multi-scale temporal difference transformer and a\nlong-term temporal transformer. The former focuses on modeling local temporal\ninformation, the latter aims at modeling global temporal information. At last,\nwe propose a new loss to narrow the distance of similar samples. Extensive\nexperiments show that backbone, such as CLIP, with MSTDT has attained a new\nstate-of-the-art result.", "journal": ""}

TSG is a highly flexible plug-and-play module, and can\neasily be incorporated with any encoder-decoder-based hierarchical vision\nTransformer architecture. Extensive experiments on the Pascal Context and\nADE20K datasets demonstrate that our feature selection strategy achieves\nconsistent gains.", "journal": ""}

We derive algorithms to perform forward and inverse spin spherical\nharmonic transforms for functions of arbitrary spin number. These algorithms\ninvolve recasting the spin transform on the two-sphere S^2 as a Fourier\ntransform on the two-torus T^2. Fast Fourier transforms are then used to\ncompute Fourier coefficients, which are related to spherical harmonic\ncoefficients through a linear transform. By recasting the problem as a Fourier\ntransform on the torus we appeal to the usual Shannon sampling theorem to\ndevelop spherical harmonic transforms that are theoretically exact for\nband-limited functions, thereby providing an alternative sampling theorem on\nthe sphere. The computational complexity of our forward and inverse spin\nspherical harmonic transforms scale as O(L^3) for any arbitrary spin number,\nwhere L is the harmonic band-limit of the spin function on the sphere.\nNumerical experiments are performed and unfortunately the forward transform is\nfound to be unstable for band-limits above L~32. The instability is due to the\npoorly conditioned linear system relating Fourier and spherical harmonic\ncoefficients. The inverse transform is expected to be stable, although it is\nnot possible to verify this hypothesis.", "journal": "All Res.J.Phys.1:4-18,2011"}

However, finding the optimal transform for general non-Gaussian\nsources has been an open problem for decades, despite several important\nadvances that provide some partial answers regarding KLT optimality. In this\npaper, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for optimality of a\ntransform when high resolution, variable rate quantizers are employed. We hence\npresent not only a complete characterization of when KLT is optimal, but also a\ndetermining condition for optimality of a general (non-KLT) transform. This\nnecessary and sufficient condition is shown to have direct connections to the\nwell studied source separation problem. This observation can impact source\nseparation itself, as illustrated with a new optimality result. We combine the\ntransform optimality condition with algorithmic tools from source separation,\nto derive a practical numerical method to search for the optimal transform in\nsource coding. Then, we focus on multiterminal settings, for which {\\it\nconditional} KLT was shown to possess certain optimality properties for\nGaussian sources. We derive the optimal orthogonal transform for the setting\nwhere side information is only available to the decoder, along with new\nspecialized results specific to the conditions for optimality of conditional\nKLT. Finally, we consider distributed source coding where two correlated\nsources are to be transform coded separately but decoded jointly. We derive the\nnecessary and sufficient condition of optimality of the orthogonal transforms.\nWe specialize to find the optimal orthogonal transforms, in this setting, for\nspecific source densities, including jointly Gaussian sources.", "journal": ""}
